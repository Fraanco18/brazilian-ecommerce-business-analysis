# Executive Summary

This analysis evaluates the performance of a Brazilian e-commerce marketplace with a focus on revenue generation, logistics efficiency, and customer value dynamics.

Using transaction-level data, the study examines how operational scale, product mix, and customer behavior interact to shape overall business performance.

## Key Findings

1. **Geographic scale introduces logistics trade-offs**  
   States with higher sales volume do not consistently achieve better delivery performance. In several cases, increased scale is associated with longer delivery times, highlighting structural logistics constraints.

2. **High-revenue categories drive operational complexity**  
   Categories generating the majority of revenue also exhibit higher average order values and longer delivery times, increasing fulfillment risk and operational burden.

3. **Revenue is concentrated at the product level, not the customer level**  
   A small subset of products accounts for a disproportionate share of total revenue, while customer spending remains broadly distributed across the base.

4. **Customer loyalty is structurally weak**  
   RFM analysis shows that most customers fall into low-value or at-risk segments, with loyal customers contributing a relatively limited share of total revenue.

## Strategic Implication

Overall performance is driven more by product selection and operational scale than by sustained customer loyalty.  
This suggests that future performance gains are likely to come from improvements in logistics efficiency, category prioritization, and selective customer retention strategies rather than from volume-driven expansion alone.
