# Methodology Notes

This project follows a structured, business-first analytical methodology designed to translate raw e-commerce data into actionable insights.

## Analytical Approach

The analysis was conducted using the following steps:

1. **Data consolidation**  
   Multiple raw e-commerce tables were joined and transformed into a single analytical dataset to ensure consistency and comparability across metrics.

2. **Business question–driven analysis**  
   Key business questions were defined upfront based on common e-commerce decision challenges related to growth, logistics performance, and customer value.

3. **SQL-based transformation and analysis**  
   All data preparation, aggregation, and analysis were performed using SQL to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and traceability.

4. **Insight validation through visualization**  
   Analytical findings were validated and communicated through focused visualizations, emphasizing patterns, trade-offs, and operational implications.

5. **Decision-oriented interpretation**  
   Final insights were interpreted in terms of business impact, leading to practical, evidence-based recommendations rather than purely descriptive findings.

## Design Principles

- Business relevance over technical complexity  
- Reproducible and auditable transformations  
- Clear separation between data modeling and analysis  
- Insights framed around decisions, not metrics alone

This methodology mirrors real-world analytics workflows where data analysis serves as input to strategic decision-making.
