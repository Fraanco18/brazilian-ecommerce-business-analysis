# Operational & Commercial Diagnostic  
## Brazilian E-Commerce Marketplace

This document presents a comprehensive, data-driven diagnostic of a Brazilian e-commerce marketplace, combining analytical findings with actionable business recommendations.

The objective is to identify structural inefficiencies, revenue concentration risks, and customer behavior patterns, and to translate these insights into decision-oriented recommendations that support operational optimization and sustainable growth.

## 1️⃣ Context & Objective

This project delivers a data-driven diagnostic of a Brazilian e-commerce marketplace, focusing on logistics performance, revenue concentration, and customer behavior.

The objective is to identify structural inefficiencies and revenue risks, and to translate analytical findings into actionable business insights that support operational optimization and sustainable growth.

## 2️⃣ Key Findings

### 1. Geographic Scale Comes with Trade-offs

Delivery performance varies significantly across states. While high-volume regions drive growth, logistics efficiency is highly uneven.

Several states exhibit average delivery times exceeding 25 days, demonstrating that higher order volume does not guarantee faster fulfillment and that geographic scale amplifies operational complexity.

---

### 2. High-Revenue Categories Drive Operational Complexity

Revenue is highly concentrated: less than 20% of product categories generate approximately 80% of total revenue.

These high-revenue categories also show higher average order values and longer delivery times, indicating that the most profitable segments are also the most logistics-intensive.

---

### 3. Revenue Is Product-Concentrated, Not Customer-Concentrated

While revenue is concentrated at the category level, it is fragmented across customers.

The top 10% of customers account for less than half of total revenue, confirming that business performance depends on product portfolio strength rather than on a small base of high-value customers.

---

### 4. RFM Reveals a Structural Lack of Customer Loyalty

Customer segmentation shows that the majority of customers fall into low-value or at-risk segments.

Loyal and high-value customers represent a small fraction of the customer base and total revenue, reinforcing the transactional nature of the business model.

---

## 3️⃣ Business Implications

- Geographic expansion increases revenue potential but introduces significant logistics inefficiencies.
- Revenue growth is tightly coupled with a small number of operationally complex product categories, increasing dependency and portfolio risk.
- Low customer loyalty limits the scalability of retention-driven growth strategies.
- The business remains highly dependent on continuous customer acquisition to sustain revenue.

## 4️⃣ Actionable Recommendations

### 1. Optimize Logistics in High-Volume, Low-Performance States

States such as RR, AP, AM, AL, and PA combine meaningful order volume with average delivery times above 25 days.

**Recommended action:**  
Establish regional logistics partnerships or deploy micro-distribution hubs in these states to reduce delivery times by an estimated 8–10 days within 3–6 months, improving customer satisfaction and repeat purchase probability.

---

### 2. Reassess Category Profitability Using Risk-Adjusted Metrics

High-revenue categories currently drive both revenue and logistics burden.

**Recommended action:**  
Develop a composite KPI such as:

*(Category Revenue × Estimated Margin) / (Average Delivery Days + Estimated Freight Cost)*

to prioritize categories with the best risk-adjusted profitability rather than revenue alone.

---

### 3. Launch Targeted Reactivation Campaigns for At-Risk Customers

A large share of customers sits in “At Risk” segments with recent but infrequent purchases.

**Recommended action:**  
Run a 3-month pilot targeting the top 20% of at-risk customers by lifetime value, offering incentives such as free shipping or 15–20% discounts in their most purchased category, with a target reactivation uplift of +25%.

---

### 4. Reduce Portfolio Dependency by Promoting Lower-Complexity Categories

Revenue reliance on a narrow set of logistics-intensive categories increases operational risk.

**Recommended action:**  
Promote growth in lower-complexity categories such as perfumery, stationery, and office furniture, which currently show shorter delivery times and more stable operational profiles.

---

### 5. Implement Continuous Performance Monitoring (Optional)

Operational and revenue risks require early detection.

**Recommended action:**  
Build monitoring dashboards tracking average delivery days and category-level profitability by state to enable proactive decision-making and faster response to performance deviations.
